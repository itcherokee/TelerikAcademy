Joro    is    having
problems   He  broke
his  PC  and his bed
and  another bed and
several  glasses and
several other things
on    his   birthday
party   and  has  to
write            the
description  of  the
next task for the PC
Magazine     Telerik
programming  contest
Now  Joro has a very
old   PC  which  can
only  run  a console
Sure he can use that
to     write     the
description      but
theres    a    small
problem  The console
cant   justify   the
text  like  MS  Word
can  Joro needs that
functionality and he
needs     it    fast
