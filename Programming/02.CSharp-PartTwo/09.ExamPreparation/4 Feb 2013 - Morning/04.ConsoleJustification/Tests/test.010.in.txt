computing as    In a general way we can define computing to mean any goaloriented activity requiring benefiting from or creating computers Thus computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes processing structuring and managing various kinds of information doing scientific studies using computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating and using communications and entertainment media finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose and so on The list is virtually endless and the possibilities are vast    and it defines five subdisciplines of the computing field Computer Science Computer Engineering Information Systems Information Technology and Software Engineering    However Computing Curricula  also
recognizes that the meaning of computing depends on the context    Computing also has other meanings that are more specific based on the context in which the term is used For example
an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer Regardless of the context doing computing well can be complicated and difficult Because society needs people to do computing well we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline    The term computing has sometimes been narrowly defined as in a  ACM report on Computing as a Discipline    The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information their theory analysis design efficiency implementation and application The fundamental question underlying all computing is What can be efficiently automated    The term computing is also synonymous with counting and calculating In earlier times it was used in reference to mechanical computing
machines    editHistory of computing    Main articles History of computing and Timeline of computing  The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology

   The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon circa  BC Its
original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles Abaci of a more modern design are still used as calculation tools today This was the first known computer and most advanced system of
calculation known to date  preceding Greek methods by  years    editComputer    Main articles Computer Outline of computers and Glossary of computer terms  A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions The same program in its humanreadable source code form enables a programmer to study and develop the algorithm Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the central processing unit type    The execution process carries out the instructions in a
computer program Instructions express the computations performed by the computer They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions    editComputer software and hardware  Main articles Software and Computer hardware  Computer software or just software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes In other words software is a set of programs procedures algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system Program software performs the function of the program it implements either by directly providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software The term was coined to contrast to the old term hardware meaning physical devices In contrast to hardware software cannot be touched Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense meaning application software only Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers such as film tapes and records    editApplication software  Main article Application software  Application software also known as an application or an app is computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks Examples include enterprise software accounting software office suites graphics software and media players Many application programs deal principally with documents Apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software or may be published separately Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one
   Application software is contrasted with system software and middleware which manage and integrate a computers capabilities but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user The system software serves the application which in turn serves the user    Similar relationships apply in other fields For example a shopping mall does not provide the merchandise a shopper is seeking but provides space and services for retailers that serve the shopper A bridge may similarly support rail tracks which support trains allowing the trains to transport passengers    Application software applies the power of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose Some apps such as Microsoft Office are available in versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements and are thus called for example a Geography
application for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform increasing the desirability of that platform This is called a killer application    editComputer network    Main article Computer network  A computer network often simply referred to as a network is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information Where at least one process in one device is able to sendreceive data tofrom at least one process residing in a remote device then the two devices are said to be in a network    Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data communications protocol used scale topology and organizational scope    Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network and provide the basis for network programming Wellknown communications protocols are Ethernet a hardware and Link Layer standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks and the Internet Protocol Suite which defines a set of protocols for internetworking ie for data communication between multiple networks as well as hosttohost data transfer and applicationspecific data transmission formats    Computer networking is sometimes considered a subdiscipline of electrical engineering telecommunications computer science information technology or computer engineering since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines    editInternet  Main articles Internet Outline of the Internet and Glossary of Internetrelated terms  The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite TCPIP to serve billions of users worldwide It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies The Internet carries an extensive range of information

code is written in a programming language which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages but easily translated by the computer The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behaviour customization from the machine The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the applications domain and the computer science domain The highestquality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts each person a specialist in some area of development But the term programmer may apply to a range of program quality from hacker to open source contributor to professional And a single programmer
could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the proof of concept to launch a new killer application    editComputer programmer  Main articles Programmer Software engineer and Software developer  A programmer computer programmer or coder is a person who
