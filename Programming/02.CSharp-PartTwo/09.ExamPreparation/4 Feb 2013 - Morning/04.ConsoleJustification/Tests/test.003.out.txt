I dont give a damn How its supposed to be That might work for you It
dont  work  for  me You write your truth And Ill write mine One mans
ceilings Another mans sky high Flying like an aeroplane Cry like the
lonely  whistle of a long black train Dance in the pouring rain Spit
in the eye of a hurricane Who said life has got to be so cruel Loves
the  only  rule Its written in the stars Where I fit in Its going to
hurt  sometimes You got to lose to win Youve got your sins And I got
mine  Sell  your  secrets  kiss  them  all  goodbye  Flying  like an
aeroplane   Alive  like  a  lonely  note  from  John  Coltrane  From
httpwwwelyricsnet  Run  like its a getaway Say those things that you
shouldnt  say  Think about it wouldnt that be cool If loves the only
rule  Might  be  a  wrecking ball Or just a wake up call Dont matter
where  the  pieces  fall  Oooooh  Oooooh Oooooh Im gonna fly like an
aeroplane  Cry  like  the whistle of a long black train Dance in the
pouring rain Im alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane Run like
its  a  getaway  Say  those things that you shouldnnt say Where love
loves  the  only rule Yes love loves the only rule Ah love loves the
only  rule  Love  only rule Loves the only rule Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh
